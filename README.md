**What is Advent of Code?**

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

Part of the fun is looking at how other people solve each puzzle.  Here are some I like:

- [Ruby](https://github.com/gchan/advent-of-code-ruby)
